            <p class="river_p">
                The Kings River originates in the southern Sierra Nevada Mountains as snowmelt. It is a National Wild and Scenic River with many 
                offshoots. The river flows for 132.9 miles and moves on average 2,287 cubic feet of water a second! The Kings River is considered 
                a Class 3 river, meaning that it is great for beginner and intermediate rafters. Because the river comes from snowmelt, the depth
                varies seasonally and year to year. In order to have the best experience, we recommend visting from late April to mid July, so you
                get the water before it evaporates.

                <p class="logging_p">
                    When the giant Sequoia trees were first discovered many people thought that they would be perfect for logging. The logging of these 
                    beautiful trees began in 1862 and got more popular from then on until the early 1900s. To speed up the transportation process, the 
                    logging companies built flumes or log chutes to take the logs down the mountain to the waiting railroads. The flumes had another use 
                    occationally, as an ambulance of sorts. If a man was injured up on the mountain, the workers would hollow out a log and send that man 
                    down the flumes in it. It was the fastest way to get help.
