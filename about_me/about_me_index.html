    <h2>Kayli Marple</h2>
    <p>Hello hello! I'm from the Midwest but have been all over the continental United States. I served my mission in Tokyo Japan
        and loved it so much! I've taken up making lots of Asian food now. I've been married to an absolutely wonderful man for two 
        years now, but for now its just the two of us. We love to go camping and hiking together, occationally we do some off-roading 
        too. We want to visit all of the National Parks and see beauties they have to offer. I like painting, photography, reading, 
        and Legos. Unless I'm out in nature I hate sitting in silence, so I almost always a show/movie or music playing in the background.

    <p>I'm majoring in Applied Technology. I was originally thinking of going more of a database route than a web route, 
        becasue I thought web would frustrate me but my mom took this class and it looked really great. So I'm reevaluating 
        my choices. :)
