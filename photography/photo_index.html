                <h2>Breathtaking landscape photography for your viewing pleasure!</h2>
                <p>
                    Welcome to Meredith Pearl Photography! Here you will find a variety of photographs for your viewing pleasure. Landscape 
                    photography is my passion. I love finding the little wildflowers amongst all the rest of the beauty of the world. It helps 
                    me appreciate the simple things in life. I also love night photography and doing some more creative things, like playing 
                    with lights and fireworks in my shoots. Unfortunately, you won’t see much night photography in the collections yet because 
                    I’m still trying to get the technique down. However, you will see a few parts of several cities, lots of nature and the 
                    gorgeous blue ocean. As a broke college student, I have yet to have the chance to travel far so the collection is a little 
                    limited for now. If there is a part of any collection that you want to see more of use the form on the Request Photos page 
                    and I can update that collection.
