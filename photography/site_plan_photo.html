        Adventures brought to your home! 
        Breathtaking landscape photography for your viewing pleasure!
        Welcome to Meredith Pearl Photography! Landscape photography is my passion. I love finding the little wildflowers amongst all the rest
        of the beauty of the world. It helps me appreciate the simple things in life. I also love night photography and doing some more creative 
        things, like playing with lights and fireworks in my shoots. Unfortunately, you won’t see much night photography in the collections yet 
        because I’m still trying to get the technique down. However, you will see a few parts of several cities, lots of nature and the gorgeous
        blue ocean.

      <h3>Request Photos</h3>
      <p>
        Didn’t see something? Let me know!
        I strive to share unique and beautiful pictures of this earth with all of you. However, I haven’t had the chance to travel very far to 
        obtain these photos, so the collections are somewhat limited. If there is a place you are wishing to see, let me know and I will do my 
        best to provide them promptly. Requests for anything on the west coast of the United States will be answered quickest (because that’s 
        where I live), others will take time. Thank you for your patience!

        You can also request a “crazy” idea! (But nothing too crazy 😉) For example, things that play with lights or fireworks I can give you 
        descent results (see the Other collection for some fireworks photos). I’m willing to try almost anything though. 

        If you’d like to know more about any photo in one of the collections, please contact me and I will give you all that I know about it, 
        location, or history or whatever.
