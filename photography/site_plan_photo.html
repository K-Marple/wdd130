        Adventures brought to your home! 
        Breathtaking landscape photography for your viewing pleasure!
        Welcome to Meredith Pearl Photography! Here you will find a variety of photographs for your viewing pleasure. Landscape photography is 
        my passion. I love finding the little wildflowers amongst all the rest of the beauty of the world. It helps me appreciate the simple 
        things in life. I also love night photography and doing some more creative things, like playing with lights and fireworks in my shoots. 
        Unfortunately, you won‚Äôt see much night photography in the collections yet because I‚Äôm still trying to get the technique down. However, 
        you will see a few parts of several cities, lots of nature and the gorgeous blue ocean. As a broke college student, I have yet to have 
        the chance to travel far so the collection is a little limited for now. If there is a part of any collection that you want to see more 
        of use the form on the Request Photos page and I can update that collection.

      <h3>Request Photos</h3>
      <p>
        Didn‚Äôt see something? Let me know!
        I strive to share unique and beautiful pictures of this earth with all of you. However, I haven‚Äôt had the chance to travel very far to 
        obtain these photos, so the collections are somewhat limited. If there is a place you are wishing to see, let me know and I will do my 
        best to provide them promptly. Requests for anything on the west coast of the United States will be answered quickest (because that‚Äôs 
        where I live), others will take time. Thank you for your patience!

        You can also request a ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù idea! (But nothing too crazy üòâ) For example, things that play with lights or fireworks I can give you 
        descent results (see the Other collection for some fireworks photos). I‚Äôm willing to try almost anything though. 

        If you‚Äôd like to know more about any photo in one of the collections, please contact me and I will give you all that I know about it, 
        location, or history or whatever. If you are interested in obtaining any of these photos to hang on your walls, you can put it in the 
        form or email me at meredithpearl.photography@gmail.com.
