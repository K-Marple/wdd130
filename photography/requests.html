                I strive to share unique and beautiful pictures of this earth with all of you. However, I haven’t had the chance to travel very 
                far to obtain these photos, so the collections are somewhat limited. If there is a place you are wishing to see, let me know 
                and I will do my best to provide them promptly. Requests for anything on the west coast of the United States will be answered 
                quickest (because that’s where I live), others will take time. Thank you for your patience!

                If you’d like to know more about any photo in one of the collections, please contact me and I will give you all that I know 
                about it, location, or history or whatever. If you are interested in obtaining any of these photos to hang on your walls, 
                you can put it in the form or email me at meredithpearl.photography@gmail.com.

                You can also request a “crazy” idea! (But nothing too crazy 😉) For example, things that play with lights or fireworks I can 
                give you descent results (see the Other collection for some fireworks photos like the one to the left). I’m willing to try 
                almost anything though.
